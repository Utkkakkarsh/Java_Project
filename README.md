Online Voting System-
A simple, graphical user interface (GUI) based voting application built using Java Swing. This project provides a basic framework for an electronic voting system where registered voters can cast their vote for a political party, and the results can be displayed in real-time.

üìú Description
This application presents a window where a user can enter their Voter ID, select a party from a list of options, and cast their vote. It includes validation to ensure that only registered voters can participate and that each person can only vote once. It also provides a feature to display the current vote tally for all parties.

Voter Authentication: Checks if the entered Voter ID is valid and registered in the system.

Prevent Multiple Votes: Ensures that a voter can cast their ballot only once.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use GUI built with Java Swing components.

Real-time Results: A "Show Results" button to display the current vote count for each party at any time.

Pre-registered Voters: The system is initialized with a list of 1000 registered voters (from "V1" to "V1000").
